## 💻 Devang Angchekar – Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive and responsive portfolio website built using **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**, and animated using **Canvas and DOM effects**. This project showcases my **skills**, **projects**, **certifications**, **résumé**, and includes a hidden **CLI-style terminal** as a fun Easter egg.
